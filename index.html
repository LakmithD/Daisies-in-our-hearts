        <h3>LOVE; AN ATTEMPT TO DEFINE</h3>  <p>“If you ever want to kill me <br>
Stab me here,” you take my hand<br>
And place it on the delicate spot<br>
Towards the left side of your neck.<br>
“I will be dead within fifteen minutes”<br>
I touch you there gently, kiss it<br>
As softly as I can. I take my heart<br>
Out of my chest as if plucking<br>
An apple from a tree, place it<br>
On a platter and give it to you.<br>
Along with a knife. You take<br>
The apple, store it safely in<br>
Your ribcage. You wouldn’t even<br>
Look at the knife. After all,<br>
What is love if not giving them<br>
The power to kill you and still<br>
Trusting them not to?<br><br>
“Your body is a temple,” you whisper<br>
In my ear. You touch me like<br>
I’m a shrine and look at me like<br>
I’m heaven. I kneel before you<br>
Like a sinner before God, take<br>
Your face in my palms like<br>
I’m holding the moon. “Your eyes<br>
Are that of God”, I tell you.<br>
“Your smile is that of an angel”,<br>


</p>
</div>
    	<div> 2
      <p><br><br><br>
        You tell me. We light candles
At the altar, watch them drip<br>
Into pools of wax, holding<br>
Each other’s hands as if<br>
Clinging onto faith. After all,<br>
What is love if not finding<br>
In them the face of your God? <br>
<br><br>
I hurl you into the fire like<br>
A badly written poem. You throw<br>
Word-shaped daggers at my chest.<br>
But as soon as you’re on fire,<br>
I pull you out of the hot mess,<br>
Hold you close to my heart,<br>
Kiss the burnt edges. But as<br>
Soon as I’m hurt, you run to me<br>
With bandages, sit on the floor,<br>
Wrapping my wounds like<br>
Presents. After all,<br>
What is love if not breaking<br>
Hearts and putting them back<br>
Together?

        <h3>“LOVE BREAKS MY BONES AND I LAUGH” </h3>
        <p> –Charles Bukowski – </p>

      </div>
    	<div> 4 <br><br><br><br><br>
        <p>
          I am on the floor<br>
Drawing a kolam<br>
With blood. You step<br>
Inside the lines. I do<br>
Not know how to ask<br>
You to leave, so I let you<br>
Take my hands in yours.<br>
You bring them to your<br>
Lips. The crimson pattern<br>
Is now dry under the sun.<br>
You place your palm<br>
On my chest, take a single<br>
Drop of blood with your<br>
Forefinger and place it<br>
On my forehead like bindi.<br>
You’ve become part<br>
Of the design.
<br><br>

I am buried in a coffin<br>
In a wedding dress.<br>
You take off your ring,<br>
Tie me to the bed. Dissect<br>
My heart with white-gloved<br>
Hands. Blood splatters<br>
Like mud under cart wheels.<br>
You take me to the yard, <br>
Bury me under the stars. <br>
I am the coin you threw<br>
Into the wishing well.<br>
Now I stand inside<br>
The walls you built. <br>
I cannot find the <br>
Lines I drew. <br>
I’ve become a heap<br>
Of aching bones.<br>
<br>
Yet I laugh.

        <h3>TERRIBLE GOLDEN WINGS</h3>
        <p>
          You tell me I cannot fly <br>
And because I believe <br>
Every word you say, <br>
I walk into my room <br>
And stare into the mirror <br>
For so long until my wings <br>
Begin to disappear <br>
Before my own eyes. <br>
Lose colour, <br>
Grow transparent,<br>
Fade into all the colours<br>
From the background.<br>

<br>
I almost killed my mother <br>
The day I was born.<br>
I was born with wings <br>
You see, wings that<br>
Started flapping <br>
The moment I breathed,<br>
Ripping her insides <br>
And making her bleed. <br>
YOU DEADLY LITTLE THING, <br>
She laughed,<br>
BORN WITH TERRIBLE <br> <br>
GOLDEN WINGS.

        <h3> EXILED!</h3>
        <p>
          MY LOVE IS A COUNTRY and you travel<br>
Every road, sleep in every city, leave<br>
Footprints that cry I’VE BEEN HERE<br>
Everywhere. THIS IS MY COUNTRY, <br>
You whisper in my ear, running your<br>
Fingers along every mountaintop,<br>
Dipping your toes in every lake,<br>
Inhaling my air as if it was your<br>
Birthright. Everything traces back to<br>
Yourself. IT IS MY BIRTHRIGHT, you say<br>
And I laugh because good god,<br>
What is liberation if not having<br>
My body marked as yours? And then<br>
You tell me I’VE SEEN IT ALL. Which<br>
Is to say you’re rootless and I can’t<br>
Hold you here anymore. Which is<br>
To say the world is a wide wide place<br>
And I’M JUST A COUNTRY. I’m meant<br>
To conquer the world, you tell me<br>
And I laugh because I know “conquer”<br>
To you means travel around, sleep around.<br>
Never settle. You spit on my earth and<br>
Throw candy wrappers in my seas and<br>
Suddenly I’m all quicksand and whirlwinds,<br>
Erupting in volcanoes. RUN AWAY, COWARD.<br>
I’m still laughing and the trees fall with<br>
Landslides and you’re packing your bags.<br>
MY LOVE IS A COUNTRY.<br> BUT DARLING,<br><br>
NOW YOU’VE BEEN EXILED.

        <h3>LOVE AND MOUTHS </h3>
        <p>
          Love spills into my mouth<br>
Like sunlight, thawing the ice<br>
Cubes I hold with my tongue.<br>
Coldness transforms into<br>
Liquid warmth that I can gulp<br>
Down my throat. There are<br>
Roses blooming in my mouth,<br>
I can feel the petals<br>
Against my palate, tasting<br>
Like the renaissance. It is<br>
The birth of a new universe.<br>
<br><br><br>
Love sits in my mouth<br>
Like shards of glass that<br>
I can’t spit out. The moment<br>
I think I’ve swallowed them all<br>
I find more-there’s always<br>
More. Hanging on my inner<br>
Cheeks like swords on a wall.<br>
Regenerating out of empty<br>
Space. I’m left with<br><br>
A mouthful of blood.

        <h3> ILLEGITIMATE CHILD CRISIS</h3>
        <p>I called myself BILINGUAL all this time<br>
But I looked up the meaning of the<br>
Word the other day and it said it’s<br>
Someone who can speak TWO languages <br>
FLUENTLY and I don’t know what to call<br>
Myself anymore. I DO NOT EVEN SPEAK<br>
ONE LANGUAGE FLUENTLY. My father loved<br>
MANY women, they say my mother was<br>
ONE of them so they chased him away.<br>
They say he needed to go. THE RAPIST<br>
NEEDED TO GO. Now I live in TWO HOUSES<br>
BUT KNOW NO HOME. I wake up in my<br>
Mother’s house but I’m certain I went to<br>
Sleep in my father’s the night before. <br>
HE DOESN’T KNOW ME, I’m ONE <br>
Of his MANY kids after all. And <br>
Somehow SHE SEEMS ANGRY<br>
THAT I’M ONLY HALF HERS.<br>
ENGLISH AND SINHALA ONCE MADE LOVE<br>
AND THEY NAMED IT RAPE. NOW I’M <br>
AN ILLEGITIMATE CHILD.

        <h3> A DOUBLE OBITUARY </h3>
        <p>
          Friendship- died on 18th March, 2021,<br>
When she was just 5 years old. She had<br>
Been a fragile child with hopeful eyes too<br>
Big for her face. The first time we took her<br>
Out for ice cream, she had stood in the sun<br>
In her purple summer dress holding a melting<br>
Vanilla cone in her hands. Laughed and said<br>
“Me want ice cream shop when me is big”<br>
With the childish passion of a kid who<br>
Doesn’t know what she wants. Next winter<br>
She had knocked on our bedroom door<br>
When we were about to make love, found<br>
Her coughing up blood on the wooden floor.<br>
I had reached for your hand when we were<br>
Waiting for the doctor’s news in the hospital<br>
Room and you had frowned and looked<br>
The other way. When the doctor said she<br>
Was dying, you had turned bitter and then<br>
Angry, screamed it was my fault and I had<br>
Cried alone because we were losing not<br>
Only our child but also each other. On <br>
7th April, 2021, Marriage died. You had<br>
Filed for divorce and packed your bags and<br>
Taken her purple summer dress with you.<br>
I have put her ashes in a jar and kept it<br>
On the dining table along with the<br>
Strawberry jam she liked.

        <h3> ANGEL; UNWINGED. </h3>
        <p>
          He had laughed when they tied him<br>
To a cloud with golden rope, laughed<br>
When they took up knives and axes<br>
And cut off his wings from his back.<br>
Blood trickled down his back and<br>
Fell on the soft cotton cloud and<br>
It turned into the most exquisite<br>
Candy floss. He said “And I no longer<br>
Carry the burdens of heaven” and<br>
Laughed till tears rolled down his<br>
Face. He said “And now I’m human<br>
And Good Lord, now I can love” And<br>
Then he fell on to my lap from the<br>
Skies above and I called him my<br>
Angel and he cried. My soft boy<br>
Buries his fingers in my chest and<br>
Digs out the bullets from my heart.<br>
He kisses me gently on the forehead<br>
And I hold out a flower to him.<br>
He says “Boys don’t like flowers”<br>
But takes it anyway. And the day<br>
I don’t take one he asks me if<br>
I brought him a flower so I take<br>
My heart out of my chest like<br>
A seedless watermelon and give<br>
It to him. He wraps it in paper and<br>
Takes it home. He reads my poems<br>
And cries, says he’s never been loved<br>
Before. Says he’ll give up his wings<br>
A thousand times just to once touch<br>
My lips. Says “I liked your poem,<br>
I’ll marry you” And I say “I will<br>
Write you a hundred more” <br>

        <h3> NOTHING</h3>
        <p>This is a poem about nothing.<br>
If I had written this poem two<br>
Moons ago when you were sitting<br>
Next to me on the grass, kissing<br>
Dandelions because you felt sorry<br>
For them because everyone would<br>
Blow and nobody would kiss and<br>
It made you sad, this would’ve been<br>
A poem about love. This would’ve<br>
Been a poem about moon-soaked hair<br>
And wine-stained dresses and a<br>
Thousand little dandelions sitting<br>
In the grass waiting for their turn<br>
To be kissed. This would’ve been<br>
A poem about lingering kisses and<br>
Brushing hands and dreams held<br>
On the palms of our hands. This<br>
Would’ve been a poem about love.<br>
But two moons have passed and<br>
They have buried you under the same<br>
Grass and blown dandelions your way.<br>
I have broken my heart and put it back<br>
Together and started writing a poem<br>
About love only to realize I can only<br>
Write about things I believe in.<br> So<br>
Here it is. <br><br>This is a poem about nothing.

        <h3> HOPE THAT KILLS</h3>
        <p>I don’t mind the pain, <br>
It’s the hope that kills me. <br>
I pick hope from my chest <br>
Like a flower from a tree <br>
And hold it close to my nose, <br>
Inhale the deadly fumes<br>
Into my lungs. <br>
I hold hope in my hands<br>
Like a blood-dripping dagger, <br>
Stand still like a corpse, <br>
Watch the blood collect at my feet. <br>
I feed on hope like raw meat,<br>
Claw into flesh like a starved beast.<br>
I carve hope into the wall<br>
Like tally marks, count the days<br>
Till I next see your face. <br>
(You have always tasted
So much like hope)
I don’t mind the pain,<br><br>
It’s the hope that kills me.

        <h3> LOVE; SYNONYM FOR VIOLENCE </h3>
        <p>
          FOR ALL THE LOVE POEMS YOU WRITE<br>
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT LOVE IS,<br>
Your words cut into me like knives.<br>
I DO KNOW LOVE, I want to tell you.<br>
I DO. IN FACT, IT IS THE ONLY THING<br>
I KNOW. The love you know is not<br>
The love I know. I read somewhere<br>
Too much love is violence. (Water<br>
The plant too much and it dies) <br>
That is what you’re trying to tell<br>
Me, I know. BUT I’M A CURSED <br>
THING. I do not know moderation.<br>
I ONLY KNOW HOW TO LOVE IN<br>
FLOODS AND TSUNAMI WAVES. <br>
In sonnets and moonlight. I pour<br>
Love into you until my chest is bare,<br>
You tell me I should store some<br>
Of it inside my ribs for myself.<br>
THAT IN DOING SO, I’M DROWNING<br>
YOU. I’m too much for you to hold.<br>
BUT THIS IS THE ONLY LOVE I KNOW.<br>
(IT IS LOVE. IT IS) The love I know<br>
Is not the love you know. Forgive me,<br>
SOMETIMES I DON’T KNOW HOW<br>
TO TELL THE THORN FROM THE ROSE.<br>
You think less is more. I think more is<br>
More. AND BECAUSE IT IS SO, I KILL<br>
THE THINGS I TOUCH. And because it<br>
Is so, you die under my touch.

        <h3> A WARNING </h3>
        <p>
          IF YOU HAD ANY SENSE, YOU WOULD STAY<br>
AWAY FROM ME. I killed a cockroach<br>
The other day, stomped on it until it<br>
Stopped moving beneath my feet. Left<br>
Its fragile little body on the floor,<br>
Crushed wings and all, locked myself<br>
In my room and cried all night.<br> (That
Did not bring him back to life)<br> I’M
TELLING YOU, IF YOU HAD ANY SENSE<br>
YOU WOULD STAY AWAY FROM ME.<br>
I hold my bloody hands under water<br>
Until the water turns red, soap them<br>
In frenzy, again and again, but no matter<br>
How hard I try I cannot remove the stains.<br>
(The first thing you’ll notice when you<br>
See me is the crimson of my hands) <br>
DON’T YOU SEE, I HAVE IT IN ME<br>
TO KILL. I carry pain inside my chest<br>
Until it turns to rage, carry rage inside<br>
My chest, simmering, boiling, until it<br>
Poisons me from within- I’M <br>
AN UNFEELING ROTTING THING. I bleed<br>
On those who don’t cut me. I would<br>
Leave you dying on the floor, crushed<br>
Wings and all. <br>KEEP AWAY, <br>I’M
WARNING YOU. <br><br>I HAVE IT IN ME TO KILL.
